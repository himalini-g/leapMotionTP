Description:

Leap Motion tracks the trajectory from a finger gun to the laptop screen to map the aim of
the gun so that the player can shoot by using their thumb as a trigger. This game is essentially a first
person shooter with the shooting ‘trigger’ done via hand gestures mapped with Leap Motion.
The scene is a cave and you are shooting down Bats and Spiders. The cave  stalagmites and stalactites are
Autogenerated. The sprites were made by me.
